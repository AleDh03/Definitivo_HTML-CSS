            Tardigrades (/ˈtɑːrdɪɡreɪd/), known colloquially as water bears or moss piglets, are a phylum of
            eight-legged segmented micro-animals. They were first described by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim
            Goeze in 1773, who called them little water bears. In 1777, the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani named them
            Tardigrada /tɑːrˈdɪɡrədə/, which means "slow steppers".
            They have been found everywhere in Earth's biosphere, from mountaintops to the deep sea and mud volcanoes, and from
            tropical rainforests to the Antarctic. Tardigrades are among the most resilient animals known, with individual
            species able to survive extreme conditions—such as exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme pressures (both high
            and
            low), air deprivation, radiation, dehydration, and starvation—that would quickly kill most other known forms of
            life. Tardigrades have survived exposure to outer space. There are about 1,300 known species in the
            phylum Tardigrada, a part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa consisting of animals that grow by ecdysis such as arthropods
            and
            nematodes. The earliest known true members of the group are known from Cretaceous amber in North America, but are
            essentially modern forms, and therefore likely have a significantly earlier origin, as they diverged from their
            closest
            relatives in the Cambrian, over 500 million years ago.
